## Hunger

Hunger has been altered by [Spice of Life](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-spice-of-life)
so that eating the same foods repeatedly
will replenish less and less of your food
bar. Check out the [farming](farming.md) section for
ideas on how to cope, but you'll find you
want to make yourself a lunch bag as soon
as you can:

## Injuries

When you are attacked in Brunel, you take
damage to specific parts of your body,
thanks to the addition of the [First Aid](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/first-aid)
mod. Depending upon where you are
injured, you may have to cope with
various forms of illness until you heal.
Careful, though... sufficient damage to
the head or body is instantly fatal, even
if you are otherwise unhurt!

## Healing

Healing in Brunel works very much like in
the real world: with rest and medical
attention. The [First Aid](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/first-aid) mod disables
regeneration, and adds various ways to
heal yourself. Try some bandages if you
get hurt, or just take a nap!

## Dying

If you do die, then the [Gravestone](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/gravestone-mod) mod
will plant a headstone just above where
you died, and [JourneyMap](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/journeymap) will drop a
waypoint guiding you back to it. By
breaking the headstone, you can get back
all the arms, armor, and loot you had
with you at the time.

## Light

Unlike in vanilla Minecraft, the dark
places of Brunel are truely dark. You'll
experience pitch black caves, and some
truely dark nights during a new moon. On
the other hand, a full moon casts quite a
bit of light!

## Sleeping

Sleeping works mostly the same as with
vanilla Minecraft, except that any one
player sleeping is enough to trigger the
whole server to sleep. If you don't want
to reset your spawn location at the same
time, check out the sleeping bag.

## Trading

Players can trade with one another on the
server by using the [Vending Block](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/vending-block)
machines. Build one of these and configure
it with the exchange you'd like to make,
and you're off to the market! You will
even start the game with a little pocket
money.
![Gold Coin](item:justcoins:gold_coin)

Players can set up their own mail-order
catalog with the [Forestry](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/forestry) Trade
Station and Catalog. Just build and
place a Trade station to post your
trades, and open up the Catalogue to see
what everyone else has posted.
