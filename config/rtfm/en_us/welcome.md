## Welcome!

Welcome to Brunel: the full-scale,
steam-powered, modpack for Minecraft
1.12.2! The world is set for a steampunk
themed adventure with huge machines,
huge logomotives, huge steamships, and
dirigibles!

Dangerous creatures have been banished
to dark caves and other dimensions, but
we don't want things to get too easy, so
we've included realistic seasons, healing
and hunger:

and materials to build with:

monsters:

## Server Rules

Brunel is a cooperative multi-player
server where we all try to help one
another, and leave room for everyone's
individual creations. As such, we have
some basic ground rules:

+ No uninvited player vs. player combat.
+ Do not disturb anything which appears
  to have been made by another player.
+ Do not build anything within sight of
  another player's constructions without
  talking it over with them first.
+ Make it easy for others to figure out
  that you made something.
+ Don't tear up the landscape without
  making something better out of it.
