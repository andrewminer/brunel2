## Ore Generation

Brunel uses a highly customized ore
generation scheme. Instead of all ores
appearing at different altitudes (no
matter where you are in the world), ores
generate differently in various regions
all around the world. These regions are
defined by biome type (e.g., forest,
sandy, ocean, snowy, etc.) and altitude:

+ lava: 0–12
+ deep: 12–48
+ buried: 48–64
+ surface: 64–80
+ hills: 80–128
+ mountains: 128–256

Within each region (i.e., each biome /
altitude pairing), each type of ore may
spawn with a different density:

+ none
+ trace
+ normal
+ dense

The following is a listing of the
various ores you can expect to find, and
a rough description of where they can be
found in greatest abundence.

### Coal
![Coal Ore](item:minecraft:coal_ore)

Coal can be found in moderate amounts
all over the world. Howver, it is much
more common in hills and swamps.

### Iron
![Iron Ore](item:minecraft:iron_ore)

Like coal, iron can be found in small
amounts all over the world. However, it
is much more easily found deep under the
high places of the world.

### Nickel
![Nickel Ore](item:basemetals:nickel_ore)
![Platinum Ore](item:basemetals:platinum_ore)

While nickel can often be found mixed
with over metals, the purest veins of it
are found deep underground all around the
world.

### Gold
![Gold Ore](item:minecraft:gold_ore)

Gold is quite rare, and can only be
found in the hottest and driest of
climates, with the greatest
concentrations forming just above
bedrock.

### Lapis
![Lapis Ore](item:minecraft:lapis_ore)

Lapis can only be found under rivers
and oceans with the highest amounts
deep under river beds.

### Diamond
![Diamond Ore](item:minecraft:diamond_ore)

Diamonds form under great heat and
pressure and appear most commonly among
lava pools deep in the ground. The
higher the terrain above, the more
diamonds form below.

### Emerald
![Emerald Ore](item:minecraft:emerald_ore)

Emeralds are actually the same material
as diamonds: simply with impurities
which affect the color. They can,
therefore, be found mixed in with
diamond deposits in all the same
locations.

### Tin
![Tin Ore](item:basemetals:tin_ore)

Tin is most commonly found mixed with iron
deposits, but some can also be found in the
gravel at the bottoms of rivers and oceans.

### Copper
![Copper Ore](item:basemetals:copper_ore)

Copper is most commonly found deep under
plains, although small amounts can also
found mixed with gold.

### Apatite
![Apatite Ore](item:forestry:resources@0)

Apatite is a powerful fertilizer, so it's
presence is usually indicated by large
amounts of plant life.

### Aluminum
![Aluminum Ore](item:modernmetals:aluminum_ore)

Aluminum is only found in hot climates, and
in can most easily be found in exposed cliffs.

### Silver & Lead
![Silver Ore](item:basemetals:silver_ore)
![Lead Ore](item:basemetals:lead_ore)

Veins of silver and lead ore are found
together in the coldest climates of the
world. While they can easily be found at
any altitude, they form dense deposits
only deep underground.

### Uranium & Lead
![Uranium Ore](item:modernmetals:uranium_ore)
![Lead Ore](item:basemetals:lead_ore)

No proper use for Uranium has yet been
discovered, although, in large enough
amounts, the metals itself gets
alarmingly hot... Even being only
found deep in the Earth, it will lays
waste to any plants and animals above
it, and causes people living there to go
mad...
