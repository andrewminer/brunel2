# Animal Husbandry

## Wild Animals

Thanks to [Animania](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/animania), Brunel boasts a huge
variety of animals from mundane to
exotic. Instead of one cheerful pink
porker, there are a half-dozen different
kinds of pigs... and cows, and sheep, and
chickens, and... you get the idea. There
are even a few species you won't normally
find in Minecraft. For example, you may
find draft horses capable of pulling a
fancy covered wagon...

## Animal Breeding

Many of the animals added by [Animania](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/animania) can
be bred very much like regular Minecraft
animals. There are a few differences,
though:

* the animals must be healthy
* the animals must be fed and watered
* the animals must be opposite genders

Then, feed them both some favorite food,
and then they will... you know. After a
short pregnancy, a baby will be born.
Different animals have different required
conditions, so study up!

# Gardening

## Wild Gardens

[Pam's HarvestCraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/pams-harvestcraft) adds a huge variety of
plants: many of which can be found
growing wild in various little "gardens"
throughout the world. Just break the
garden to find out what plants it has
inside.

You might find it best to convert your
finds into seeds and plant them in your
own garden, so you can always have access
to them later.

## Crop Breeding

[Agricraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/agricraft) introduces techniques for
improving your crops, and even breeding
new species by intermingling those you
have discovered.

## Automated Farming

If you ever get tired of tending your
farms manually, [Forestry](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/forestry) has you covered.
It offers a complete set of farm
equipment which will free your time for
other pursuits... if you're willing to
build all the parts you're going to need!
![Farm Gearbox](block:forestry:ffarm@2)

If that's not your thing, you can use
the cloche from [Immersive Engineering](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/immersive-engineering)
for growing plants on a much smaller
scale.

# Arborculture

## Orchard Trees

In addition to crops, [Pam's HarvestCraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/pams-harvestcraft)
adds trees which produce a variety of
tasty and useful fruits, nuts, and other
products. These are scattered throughout
the world in the regions where they
naturally grow best. Collect three fruits
and combine with any generic sapling to
plant your own fruit trees.

## Tree Breeding

Many of the more unique trees you find in
the wild can be cross-bred to produce new
and even more spectacular species.
[Forestry](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/forestry) provides the tools and machines
to collect pollen and saplings, and then
to combine them into new species.
![Grafter](item:forestry:grafter)

## Bee Breeding

Of course, in order to pollenate trees,
one needs pollinators! Here, again,
[Forestry](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/forestry) provides everything you need
from wild hives you can harvest for bees
to mechanized hives to look after your
tiny friends.
