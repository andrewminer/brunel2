## Mob Spawning

Mob spawning has been altered in Brunel
so that most mobs only spawn in absolute
darkness, and only underground. Don't
get complacent, though... there are still
a few which spawn above ground, and even
the underground sort will brave the world
above to come hunt...

## Biomes

Brunel uses [Biomes o'Plenty](http://biomesoplenty.wikia.com) for its
primary world generation: including both
the selection of biomes and their
placement around the world. As you
travel north and south, you should
expect to find wide (3kmâ€“5km) bands of
hotter and cooler climates. Within a
given band, traveling east and west will
let you locate wetter and dryer climates
(with no particular pattern).

## Twilight Forest

If you need a break from steam and steel,
Twilight Forest is a magical dimension
filled with beautiful, peaceful forests;
deadly monsters; magical creatures, and
fantastic treasures, the likes of which
can't be found in the mundane world.

## Mystcraft

If one world of magic and adventure
isn't enough, take up your pen and write
your way into endless worlds. Just
be sure to take a linking book to get
home again!
